# Responsive-Portfolio

An assignment for the UNC Charlotte Coding Bootcamp at first. Now the page I've decided to host my portfolio on.

I created a page to host all of my work, while also giving a brief description of myself, and providing a form to receive a request for information. Most proud of the mobile first build. Fully responsive and looks great on all screen sizes, frankly even better on phones than a desktop.
